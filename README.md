2. Calculator by W. Odermatt: W. Odermatt created these files; Additional resources.
	1. Penetrator Design Rh120 Smoothbore.xlsx: Designed to calculate Rh120-based or western style standard penetrator.
	2. Perforation Limit Jacketed Penetrator.xlsx: Designed to calculate jacketed penetrator, such as 3BM32, 3BM42.

## Quick Guide
1. Lw=Length of penetrator; ㎜
2. D=Diametre of penetrator; ㎜
3. pp=Density of penetrator material; ㎏/㎥
4. V=Velocity of penetrator; ㎧
5. HDNP=Brinell scale number(HB) of penetrator(only for Steel Alloy penetrator)
6. ρт=Density of target material; ㎏/㎥
7. HDN=Brinell scale number(HB) of target; Default is 260 HB
8. θ=Impact angle of penetrator; °

Please remind that Lw/D must be between 4 and 34.
